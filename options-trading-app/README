This application helps user to place options order by calculating the spot price by looking at the strike price. The lot size is provided from the config file.
TODO: Needed to write code for adjustments but the development was stopped as this strategy failed in many cases while back testing. 
Also, a bash script needs to be added to help the end user run easily:
        ECHO "Welcome to Options Trading Application"
        cd .\options-trading-app\target\
        java -jar options-trading-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        @pause
